        "content": "<p>We highly appreaciate that you would like to learn German!&nbsp;Approximately 100 million others in the world speak German as their native language. Your familiarity with the German language is the key to this country. We want to encourage you to, as soon as possible, to be open to the idea and to learn German.&nbsp;Success happens quickly, when you systematically learn and practice. Please decide:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Learning within predefined language levels and earning a certificate.</li>\r\n\t<li>Learning, practicing, and immersion into the language without earning a certificate.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Option 1. Learn with the predefined language levels and earn a certificate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Europe there is a framework that ranges from level A1 to C2, each level describes what stage is reached by what progress is made. Courses such as the Volkshochschule (VHS) (=adult education center)&nbsp;and the Goethe Institute&nbsp;use this system. Employers will ask, for example, if you have reached level B1 or B2, because these levels are the basic levels needed to bring you into the professional workplace. Also, by using this system, you can look forward to understanding and clearly identifying the progress you have made.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A1 - Breakthrough or beginner</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A2 - Way stage or elementary</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B1 - Threshold or intermediate</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B2 - Vantage or upper intermediate</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C1 - Effective operational proficiency or advanced</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C2 - Mastery or proficiency</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tip: Register yourself as soon as possible at your local VHS (Volkhochschule) for a language course.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The distinction is to start either in the VHS courses for Refugees (&quot;German for Refugees&quot;) or regular language courses.\r\n\t<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle\">\r\n\t\t<li>The &quot;German for Refugees&quot; course is free, and is, however, in high demand. There are only refugees in this course.</li>\r\n\t\t<li>The normal VHS German language course costs &euro;150 and has the advantage that you will have a wide variety of learners</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li>There are also literacy courses, courses specifically for women, and courses for the elderly.</li>\r\n\t<li>Most classes have 100 students, meet 4 or 5 days a week, before or after mid-day.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Option 2. Learning, practicing, and immersion into the language without earning a certificate</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following are options to learning German that are free/ no cost. This is, however, without certification.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Simply learn with the Internet and teaching material:</strong>&nbsp;Speak with your roommate and ask about the YouTube channels which can be helpful for you to get a taste for the language. Also the App Duolingo is a good learning program.&nbsp;This is a great start, it is an overview and just a supplement to learning German with native speakers.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Systematic learning through speech courses with volunteers in or near your housing facility:</strong> Some volunteers offer their own teaching materials and offer weekly courses. These are very appreciated because they are small learning groups and the material builds upon itself.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",

        "content": "<p>With a valid ticket you can use all public transport in Berlin: S-Bahn (suburban trains), U-Bahn (underground trains), busses and tramways. The price of the ticket depends on the zone you travel in and the period you need the ticket for (i.e. just for one trip, for one day, for one week or for an entire month etc.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Zones and Maps: </strong>In Berlin there are three travel zones: AB, BC and ABC. Zone AB comprises the entire city of Berlin up to the city boundary. Zone ABC additionally comprises the surroundings of Berlin and Potsdam. You will find maps of the public transport in all stations. The various lines are marked with different symbols and colors. The U stands for U-Bahn (underground train) and the S stands for S-Bahn (suburban train). For example, on the public transport map, you will find the line U5 is colored in brown and the line S7 is colored in purple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fares</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Single Ticket (Einzelfahrschein):</strong> With a single ticket, one person can use the public transport for two hours in any direction. You cannot use a single ticket, however, to return to the station where you originally started from.&nbsp;Price: Zone AB: 2,70 EURO; Reduced: 1,70 EURO. Zone ABC: 3,30 EURO; Reduced: 2,40 EURO</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Single Short Trip Ticket (Kurzstrecke): </strong>You can use a short trip&nbsp;ticket if you only travel three stops by U-Bahn (underground) or S-Bahn (suburban train). On the bus or tramway you can use a short trip&nbsp;ticket for travelling up to six stops without change of lines.&nbsp;Price: 1,60 EURO, Reduced 1,20 EURO.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Tickets for Children:</strong> Children up to the age of six years do not need a ticket when travelling with an adult. Children between six and fourteen years of age need a reduced ticket for 1,70 EURO in Zone AB no matter if single ticket or short trip ticket.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Day Ticket (Tageskarte) for 1 person: </strong>With a day ticket, you can use all public transport for the entire day. It is valid from the time you stamp it until the next day 3am. A Day Ticket for one person costs 6,90 EURO in Zone AB, the reduced price is 4,70 EURO.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>7-Day-Ticket for 1 person: </strong>The 7-Day-Ticket is valid for seven consecutive days from the day it is validated by stamping. It costs 29,50 EURO. The 7-Day-Ticket loses its validity on the seventh day at midnight.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Day-Ticket for Small Groups (Kleingruppen-Tageskarte)</strong>: This ticket is valid for up to five persons travelling together for all public transport from the time you stamp it until the next day 3am. For zone AB it costs 16,90 EUROS.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Monthly Ticket (Monatskarte)</strong>: You can choose if this ticket should be valid for one month (e.g. October) or for 30 days (e.g. October 12 to November 11). It costs 79.50 EURO.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>For more information on the tickets, please visit:&nbsp;https://shop.bvg.de/index.php/tickets</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&bdquo;Berlinpass&ldquo;: </strong>When you arrive in Berlin, you will receive the so-called berlinpass. Amongst other things, it will give you a discount for getting around in Berlin by public transport (BVG). A monthly card AB (Berlin-Ticket S) costs EURO 36 with berlinpass and is valid from the first date of each month until the last date of the same month.&nbsp; You can buy it only in the train stations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Buying a Ticket: </strong>You can buy a ticket at the ticket machine on the platforms of the U-Bahn and the S-Bahn. The ticket machines have options for various languages so you can choose the language you are most comfortable with. When using a bus, you buy your ticket from the bus driver. For the tramway you get your ticket at the ticket machine inside the tramway. At larger stations there are also booths where you can buy your ticket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Validate Your Ticket: </strong>Before you start your journey you need to validate your ticket. You do this by stamping the ticket at one of the yellow or red boxes on the platforms, inside the busses or the tramways. Please note that without this stamp the ticket is regarded as invalid!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fare-Dodging in Berlin: </strong>If you use public transport without a valid ticket and you come across a ticket inspector, you will be asked to pay an &ldquo;increased fare&rdquo; of EURO 60. In this context, please remember that you need to stamp your ticket to validate it. The ticket inspectors do not make any exceptions for passengers unaware of these rules. A ticket inspector may ask you to show proof of your identity. If there are any problems the police might be called.</p>\r\n",
