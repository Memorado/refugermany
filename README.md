_A practical Guide to Germany for Asylum Seekers_

This app is co-produced by a pro-bono project of [Memorado](http://www.memorado.com) and by [FREEDOMUS](http://www.freedomus.berlin/). It was one of the four apps developed as a part of **Memorado's Hack Week 2015** - A 4-day company-wide hackathon held in September 2015. The purpose was to create apps with that help Refugees in a simple way.

### The idea
During the Hack Week we had the privilege to talk to the team of [FREEDOMUS](http://www.freedomus.berlin/team/) who have been helping refugees in Germany for quite some time. They prepare a guide to welcome refugees into Germany that provides them all the most relevant information. This guide contains practical information about the asylum process and also about day-to-day life and culture in their new home country.

### The Challenge
The printed welcome guide is very well accepted to all asylum seekers in Germany. It has been translated to multiple languages and contains vital information to people undergoing this long process. The main issues are the cost of distribution and the need to keep the material ever updated, so the information contained is always relevant.

### The Solution
This is why during the Memorado Hack Week, we sat down with the organizers of FREEDOMUS to sketch out a digital version of the Welcome Guide that solves these problems. 
 - Made for iOS and Android, thanks to Xamarin.
 - Has most of the relevant data offline
 - Can be updated via a backend
 - Supports multiple languages (English, German and Arabic so far but more to come)

### The App
This app can be downloaded in the following links:
 - [Download for Android from the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.memorado.welcomeGuide)
 - [Download for iOS from the Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/refugermany-useful-guide-for/id1045437199
)

### The Future
There's still some features that we would like to see on this app, that the time limitations of a Hackathon didn't allow us to include
 - Ability to read PDF files inside the app. 
 - Include more important PDFs with the app, for offline reading.
 - Natively integrated sharing feature
 - Ability to comment on articles
 - Ability to rate and reply to comments
